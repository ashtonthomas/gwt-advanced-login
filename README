GwtAdvancedLogin
by Ashton Thomas (www.acrinta.com)

This Google Web Toolkit (GWT) application is an example of how to create a separate Login Module 
which then funnels to one or many other modules that contain the main applicaiton login.

You can use this type of setup to take full control over you login page while not including it
in your main module.
